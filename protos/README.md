# profile.proto

The protobuf definition in this file has been vendored from
https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/main/proto/profile.proto and is copyright
Google, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

The Go code is generated from that protobuf definition via `protoc` and vendored
so that contributors don't need to have the protobuf compiler handy just to
build or test.
